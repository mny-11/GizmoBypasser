# GizmoBypasser
## 2 Versions Released, will only get updated if patched.
Currently what you can call the only tool allowing Free stay at internet cafe's managed by the [Gizmo Software](https://www.gizmopowered.net/) ,
which this tool was meant as hatred towards how limiting Gizmo's software really is on the fun side, but "secure" side, you have full access to everything easily.

Also meant as hatred towards most internet cafe staff being extremely unprofessional, making fun of any person for being a developer or playing a game that's not 
widely spread across the local country among teenagers in that cafe, not everyone plays valorant, if you don't like it thats understandable, but not becoming
the only topic they talk about.

And also made as how **greedy** of a company Gizmo really is, having cafe staff pay an entire euro per PC in every single indivdual country,
making internet cafe's a thing of the past, and the only ones that stay are extremely overpriced.

This tool guarantees you full unlimited time access, and i will keep developing it as long as we don't have issues,
which we wont as we use [the MIT license.](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
